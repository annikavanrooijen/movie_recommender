# Recommender
Movie-Recommender-Systems

In this project I built a web application that showcases a movie recommendation on Neighborhood-based Collaborative Filtering.

Workflow: 
 - Data: small version of the MovieLens-dataset (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
 - create a user-item matrix
 - create a web interface streamlit
 - deploy application on render 


### Usage
```bash
python recommender.py
```
